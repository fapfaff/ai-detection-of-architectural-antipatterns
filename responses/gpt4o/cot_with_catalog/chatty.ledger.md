The uploaded file appears to be a PlantUML diagram describing interactions in a service architecture for a "Ledger" system. The key services and actors include:
 
- **Rider** : The user of the system initiating and completing trips.
 
- **Trip Service (TS)** : Handles trip initiation and completion.
 
- **Payment Service (PS)** : Manages payment authorization, capture, and hold processes.
 
- **LedgerStore (LS)** : Acts as the persistence layer for payment and hold details.

### Analysis Steps 
1. **Understand the Context** 
This architecture represents a system for managing trips and payments. Key functionalities include starting and ending trips, authorizing and capturing payments, and maintaining ledger entries for financial transactions.
2. **Analyze Dependencies**  
- **Rider → Trip Service (TS)** : Rider interacts with the Trip Service to start and end trips.
 
- **TS → Payment Service (PS)** : Trip Service delegates payment-related tasks to the Payment Service.
 
- **PS → LedgerStore (LS)** : Payment Service relies on LedgerStore for persistence, such as saving and verifying holds and charges.

There is significant interaction between the Payment Service and LedgerStore, with multiple back-and-forth messages during payment processing.
3. **Identify Antipatterns** 
Based on the observed interactions, the following antipatterns may apply:
 
1. **Chatty Service** : 
  - **Manifestation** : The Payment Service makes multiple calls to the LedgerStore for operations such as "Lookup Hold," "Check Hold Status," "Retrieve Hold Details," etc.
 
  - **Impact** : This increases latency and coupling between the Payment Service and LedgerStore.
 
  - **Solution** : Introduce aggregation or batch operations to reduce the number of interactions.
 
2. **Low Cohesive Operations** : 
  - **Manifestation** : The Payment Service performs heterogeneous tasks such as authorizing, capturing payments, and managing ledger entries. This may indicate a lack of cohesion.
 
  - **Impact** : The service becomes harder to maintain and scale.
 
  - **Solution** : Split the Payment Service into smaller, more cohesive services (e.g., Authorization Service, Ledger Management Service).
 
3. **Shared Persistency** : 
  - **Manifestation** : If multiple services (e.g., Trip Service and Payment Service) directly interact with the LedgerStore.
 
  - **Impact** : This violates the principle of data ownership and can lead to data consistency issues.
 
  - **Solution** : Introduce an API or mediator for controlled access to the LedgerStore.
4. **Detailed Antipattern List**  
1. **Chatty Service**  
  - **Explanation** : Multiple fine-grained interactions between Payment Service and LedgerStore for hold management.
 
  - **Solution** : Redesign the interface to provide batch operations, such as "Manage Hold," encapsulating all related sub-operations in one request.
 
2. **Low Cohesive Operations**  
  - **Explanation** : Payment Service handles unrelated responsibilities, leading to a lack of single responsibility.
 
  - **Solution** : Refactor Payment Service into distinct services based on business capabilities.
 
3. **Shared Persistency**  
  - **Explanation** : If Trip Service and Payment Service access the same data in LedgerStore, it creates tight coupling.
 
  - **Solution** : Add a Ledger API layer to enforce controlled access and maintain single data ownership.
