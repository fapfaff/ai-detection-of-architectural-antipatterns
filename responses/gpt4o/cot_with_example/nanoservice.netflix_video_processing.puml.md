You are an IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. 
Follow a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. Understand the Context: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture's structure and purpose.
2. Analyze Dependencies: Identify how services interact and depend on each other.
3. Identify Antipatterns: List potential antipatterns and explain why they apply.
4. List each antipattern with the following details
 * The name of the antipattern.
 * A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
 * A proposed solution to address the issue.
 
Example:
**Ambiguous Service**   
- **Manifestation** : Operation IDs such as DoTrunkUpdate, ListRecord are either inconsistent or unclear.

- **Solution** : 
  - Standardize operation naming conventions (e.g., {Entity}_{Action}). 
  - Use consistent action verbs like Create, Update, Delete, Fetch.

The PlantUML file represents components involved in a "Netflix Video Processing" architecture. Based on the snippet, here's how I'll proceed:
 
1. **Understand the Context** : I'll map out the major components and their purpose.
 
2. **Analyze Dependencies** : I'll identify how these components are interconnected or dependent on each other.
 
3. **Identify Antipatterns** : I'll analyze the relationships for common architectural issues.
Now I'll parse the content further to analyze it. ​​
The extracted components and their connections from the PlantUML file suggest the following architecture:

### High-Level Summary 
 
1. **Components** : 
  - Core workflow orchestrators: `Streaming Workflow Orchestrator` and `Studio Workflow Orchestrator`.

  - Specialized services for subtitles, audio, and video processing.
 
2. **Connections** :
  - Clear dependencies exist among components, such as the orchestrators coordinating various subtitling, audio, and muxing services.
Next, I'll analyze these dependencies and identify potential architectural antipatterns. ​​
### Analysis of Dependencies 
**Dependency Map** : 
1. The `Streaming Workflow Orchestrator` coordinates with `Timed Text Service`, `Audio Encoding Service`, and potentially others.
 
2. The `Timed Text Service` depends on `Subtitle Generator` and `Subtitle Validator` for subtitling tasks.
 
3. The `Audio Encoding Service` interacts with `Audio Validation Service` and `Audio Synchronization Service`.
 
4. The `Muxing Service` likely integrates processed audio and video streams.
**Observations** :
- Several dependencies exist between orchestrators and specific services, suggesting tight coupling.
 
- The `Timed Text Service` serves as a hub for subtitling, which could become a bottleneck.

### Antipatterns Identified 
 
1. **Tight Coupling Between Orchestrators and Services**  
  - **Manifestation** : Orchestrators depend directly on multiple services, such as `Streaming Workflow Orchestrator` coordinating subtitling, audio, and video workflows.
 
  - **Solution** : Introduce an abstraction layer (e.g., microservice facades or APIs) to decouple orchestrators from individual services.
 
2. **Single Point of Failure**  
  - **Manifestation** : The `Timed Text Service` acts as a hub for subtitling, making it a single point of failure if the service goes down or experiences high load.
 
  - **Solution** : Implement service replication and load balancing to improve fault tolerance and scalability.
 
3. **Unclear Service Boundaries**  
  - **Manifestation** : Overlap between services such as `Audio Encoding`, `Audio Validation`, and `Audio Synchronization`, leading to potential redundancy and unclear ownership.
 
  - **Solution** : Clearly define service responsibilities and consolidate overlapping functionalities.
 
4. **Orchestrator Overload**  
  - **Manifestation** : The `Streaming Workflow Orchestrator` handles multiple workflows, which may lead to bottlenecks or reduced maintainability as complexity grows.
 
  - **Solution** : Delegate workflow management to specialized services or adopt event-driven choreography to reduce orchestrator workload.
 
5. **Bottleneck in Subtitling**  
  - **Manifestation** : Both `Subtitle Generator` and `Subtitle Validator` depend on `Timed Text Service`, creating a linear dependency chain.
 
  - **Solution** : Parallelize subtitling processes and explore asynchronous communication patterns.
