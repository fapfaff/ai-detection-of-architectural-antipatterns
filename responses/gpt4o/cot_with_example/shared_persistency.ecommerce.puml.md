You are an IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. 
Follow a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. Understand the Context: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture's structure and purpose.
2. Analyze Dependencies: Identify how services interact and depend on each other.
3. Identify Antipatterns: List potential antipatterns and explain why they apply.
4. List each antipattern with the following details
 * The name of the antipattern.
 * A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
 * A proposed solution to address the issue.
 
Example:
**Ambiguous Service**   
- **Manifestation** : Operation IDs such as DoTrunkUpdate, ListRecord are either inconsistent or unclear.

- **Solution** : 
  - Standardize operation naming conventions (e.g., {Entity}_{Action}). 
  - Use consistent action verbs like Create, Update, Delete, Fetch.

The uploaded PlantUML file describes the architecture of an e-commerce platform. Here's a summary of its structure and purpose:


---

**Step 1: Understand the Context** **High-Level Architecture** 
The system comprises several components, each representing a service or database. The services include:
 
1. **Frontend** : Interfaces with users.
 
2. **Ad Service** : Manages advertisements.
 
3. **Recommendation Service** : Provides product recommendations.
 
4. **Product Catalog Service** : Maintains product details.
 
5. **Cart Service** : Handles the shopping cart functionality.
 
6. **Checkout Service** : Manages the checkout process.
 
7. **Payment Service** : Processes payments.
 
8. **Email Service** : Sends notifications or confirmations.
 
9. **Shipping Service** : Handles shipping logistics.
 
10. **Currency Service** : Provides currency conversions.
 
11. **Redis Cache** : A caching layer for performance.
 
12. **Order Database** : Stores order details.


---

**Step 2: Analyze Dependencies** 
From the PlantUML relationships (arrows between components):
 
- The **Frontend**  communicates with most services (e.g., Ad, Recommendation, Product Catalog, Cart, Checkout).
 
- **Checkout Service**  interacts with the **Payment** , **Shipping** , and **Email Services** .
 
- **Cart Service**  interacts with the **Redis Cache**  for storing cart data.
 
- The **Currency Service**  is used by the **Checkout Service**  for pricing calculations.
 
- The **Order Database**  is updated by the **Checkout Service**  for order tracking.


---

**Step 3: Identify Antipatterns**  
1. **Ambiguous Service Boundaries**  
  - **Manifestation** : The **Currency Service**  might be too granular and could have been a utility within another service like Checkout. Its isolated existence increases the complexity of inter-service communication.
 
  - **Solution** : Merge Currency Service into Checkout or Product Catalog.
 
2. **Tight Coupling of Frontend and Backend**  
  - **Manifestation** : The Frontend directly communicates with too many services (Ad, Recommendation, Product Catalog, Cart, etc.), leading to tight coupling and increasing maintenance complexity.
 
  - **Solution** : Introduce an API Gateway to aggregate these calls and simplify the Frontend's responsibility.
 
3. **Shared Database**  
  - **Manifestation** : If multiple services (e.g., Checkout, Shipping, Payment) directly access the **Order Database** , it violates the principle of service independence.
 
  - **Solution** : Introduce service-specific data stores or APIs to manage database access indirectly.
 
4. **Overuse of Microservices**  
  - **Manifestation** : Smaller services like Ad Service and Recommendation Service might introduce overhead without clear justification for separate deployment.
 
  - **Solution** : Combine related functionalities (e.g., Ad and Recommendation) into a single service.
 
5. **Lack of Caching Strategy for Frequently Accessed Data**  
  - **Manifestation** : The architecture uses Redis for cart data but doesn't mention caching for high-read data like product catalog or currency rates.
 
  - **Solution** : Extend Redis or another caching mechanism for these datasets to reduce service load.


---

**Step 4: Antipattern Details** **Ambiguous Service Boundaries**  
- **Manifestation** : Currency Service is overly specific.
 
- **Solution** : Merge into larger services (e.g., Checkout or Product Catalog).
**Tight Coupling of Frontend and Backend**  
- **Manifestation** : Frontend handles multiple service interactions directly.
 
- **Solution** : Add an API Gateway for orchestration.
**Shared Database**  
- **Manifestation** : Services access Order Database directly.
 
- **Solution** : Provide APIs for service-specific database interaction.
**Overuse of Microservices**  
- **Manifestation** : Ad Service and Recommendation Service are separate but might not require independent scaling.
 
- **Solution** : Consolidate these into a unified service.
**Lack of Caching Strategy**  
- **Manifestation** : No caching for frequently accessed data like products or currency rates.
 
- **Solution** : Implement Redis or another cache for these datasets.
