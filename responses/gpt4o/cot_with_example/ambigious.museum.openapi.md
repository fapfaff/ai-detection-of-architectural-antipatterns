You are an IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. 
Follow a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. Understand the Context: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture's structure and purpose.
2. Analyze Dependencies: Identify how services interact and depend on each other.
3. Identify Antipatterns: List potential antipatterns and explain why they apply.
4. List each antipattern with the following details
 * The name of the antipattern.
 * A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
 * A proposed solution to address the issue.
 
Example:
**Antipattern 1: Chatty Service** 
**Manifestation:** 
The Payment Service (PS) makes multiple calls to the LedgerStore (LS) in quick succession:
- Lookup Hold
- Check Hold Status
- Retrieve Hold Details
- Verify Hold Amount
**Proposed Solution:**  
- Use a bulk request approach or a composite API pattern. Instead of multiple calls, PS can request all necessary details in one API call, e.g., `LS: GetHoldDetails`.
- Introduce a caching mechanism to avoid repeated lookups for data that does not frequently change.

### Step 1: Understand the Context 

The provided OpenAPI document describes an API for a hypothetical "Museum." Key endpoints include:
 
- Retrieving and managing museum hours (`/hours`).
 
- Managing special events (`/special-event-management-endpoint`).
 
- Ticket purchasing (`/buy` and `/buy/{ticket}/qr`).
 
- Publishing new events via webhooks (`publishNewEvent`).

The API seems intended for both internal and external stakeholders, supporting CRUD operations for events, purchasing tickets, and integration with other systems via webhooks.

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies 
**Key Observations:**  
1. **Event Management** : 
  - Multiple operations for events (`POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) indicate detailed resource control.
 
  - Dependency on `Id` as a path parameter implies inter-service data integrity.
 
2. **Ticket Management** :
  - Separate endpoints for purchasing and generating QR codes suggest a decoupled flow for ticket issuance.
 
3. **Pagination and Filtering** : 
  - Common use of pagination parameters (e.g., `page`, `limit`).
 
4. **Webhooks** : 
  - Use of `publishNewEvent` indicates dependency on external consumers to act on new events.

Dependencies appear moderately coupled, with resource-driven designs aiming for usability.

### Step 3: Identify Antipatterns 
**Antipattern 1: Chatty API**  
- **Manifestation** : Multiple calls needed for a single operation (e.g., managing events with multiple GET, POST, PATCH endpoints).
 
- **Proposed Solution** : Consolidate operations using composite endpoints or GraphQL to reduce network overhead.
**Antipattern 2: Ambiguous Security**  
- **Manifestation** : Use of Basic Authentication (`MuseumPlaceholderAuth`) lacks clarity on secure transmission.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : Adopt modern standards like OAuth2 or API keys with HTTPS for secure communication.
**Antipattern 3: Overfetching Data**  
- **Manifestation** : `GET /special-event-management-endpoint` retrieves all events with optional filtering, potentially fetching unnecessary data.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : Use query parameters to refine responses further, e.g., `fields` to specify required data.
**Antipattern 4: Lack of Error Detail**  
- **Manifestation** : Errors are mapped to generic schemas without specific problem resolution details.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : Expand error schemas with `code`, `message`, and `details` fields for actionable insights.
**Antipattern 5: Tight Coupling in Webhooks**  
- **Manifestation** : `publishNewEvent` directly integrates external consumers without retry logic or fail-safe mechanisms.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : Implement a queue-based retry mechanism or event-driven architecture for webhook delivery.

### Step 4: Antipattern Details 
**Antipattern 1: Chatty API**  
- **Manifestation** : Multiple operations for event management may require several calls for comprehensive workflows.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Consolidate `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` into a composite API endpoint.

  - Alternatively, use GraphQL for dynamic queries.
**Antipattern 2: Ambiguous Security**  
- **Manifestation** : Reliance on Basic Authentication increases the risk of credential interception.
 
- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Implement OAuth2 for token-based authentication.

  - Ensure all endpoints enforce HTTPS.
**Antipattern 3: Overfetching Data**  
- **Manifestation** : Bulk data retrieval may overburden clients with unnecessary information.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Introduce `fields` or `include` query parameters for selective data fetching.

  - Support pagination in more granular lists.
**Antipattern 4: Lack of Error Detail**  
- **Manifestation** : Error responses like `BadRequest` or `NotFound` lack actionable context.
 
- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Include detailed error information such as a unique error ID and suggestions.
**Antipattern 5: Tight Coupling in Webhooks**  
- **Manifestation** : Dependence on synchronous webhook delivery without a retry mechanism.
 
- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Use asynchronous delivery with retries or a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
