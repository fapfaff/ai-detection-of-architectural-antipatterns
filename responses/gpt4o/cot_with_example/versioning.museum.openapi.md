You are an IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. 
Follow a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. Understand the Context: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture's structure and purpose.
2. Analyze Dependencies: Identify how services interact and depend on each other.
3. Identify Antipatterns: List potential antipatterns and explain why they apply.
4. List each antipattern with the following details
 * The name of the antipattern.
 * A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
 * A proposed solution to address the issue.
 
Example:
**Ambiguous Service**   
- **Manifestation** : Operation IDs such as DoTrunkUpdate, ListRecord are either inconsistent or unclear.

- **Solution** : 
  - Standardize operation naming conventions (e.g., {Entity}_{Action}).
 
  - Use consistent action verbs like Create, Update, Delete, Fetch.

Based on the provided OpenAPI documentation, hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the architecture:


---

1. **Understanding the Context** 
The API appears to support a museum's operations, events, and ticketing system. Its main functionalities include:

- Fetching museum operating hours.

- Managing special events (creation, updating, deletion).

- Facilitating ticket purchases and QR code generation.

- Publishing new event notifications.

The architecture focuses on providing structured endpoints for operational efficiency and user interaction.

2. **Dependency Analysis** 
#### Identified Dependencies: 
 
1. **Shared Schemas** : Components like `EventId`, `TicketId`, and `BuyMuseumTickets` are reused across multiple endpoints.
 
2. **CRUD Operations** : Heavy reliance on CRUD for events (`/special-events`) and tickets (`/tickets`).
 
3. **Pagination** : Standardized query parameters (`page` and `limit`) for paginated endpoints.
 
4. **Security Scheme** : A placeholder basic authentication is employed for all endpoints.

#### Observations: 
 
- **Centralized Management** : Most data interactions rely on endpoints for either fetching details (`getMuseumHours`) or managing entries (`/special-events`).
 
- **Cross-Entity Interactions** : Ticketing is indirectly tied to events via `eventId`.

3. **Antipatterns** 
Here are potential antipatterns identified:
**Ambiguous Operations**  
- **Manifestation** : Operation IDs like `listSpecialEvents`, `getMuseumHours`, and `buyMuseumTickets` are inconsistent in naming. For example: 
  - Some use the entity-action convention (`getMuseumHours`), others invert this (`buyMuseumTickets`).
 
- **Solution** : Adopt a consistent naming convention, such as `{Entity}_{Action}` for all operations.
**Chatty API**  
- **Manifestation** : Multiple endpoints (`getSpecialEvent`, `getTicketCode`) require separate calls to retrieve related data. This increases client-server interactions for common workflows like ticket validation.
 
- **Solution** : Introduce aggregated endpoints (e.g., `/tickets/{ticketId}` returning both ticket details and QR code).
**Security Placeholder**  
- **Manifestation** : `MuseumPlaceholderAuth` is used as a basic scheme. This is insufficient for modern APIs and poses risks if left unchanged.
 
- **Solution** : Implement OAuth 2.0 or API key-based authentication for better security.
**Overloading with Webhooks**  
- **Manifestation** : The `publishNewEvent` webhook is generic and lacks a clear distinction between new events and updates.
 
- **Solution** : Create distinct webhooks for `newEventPublished` and `eventUpdated`.
**Redundant Parameters**  
- **Manifestation** : Both `startDate` and `endDate` are required for filtering but might lead to errors if not used cohesively.
 
- **Solution** : Provide default behaviors (e.g., `startDate` defaults to today, `endDate` defaults to 7 days ahead).
**Sparse Documentation for Errors**  
- **Manifestation** : Error responses (`BadRequest`, `NotFound`) are listed but lack detailed guidance on resolving issues.
 
- **Solution** : Expand error schema with `errorCode`, `userMessage`, and `developerMessage`.

4. **Detailed Antipattern List** **Ambiguous Operations**  
- **Manifestation** : Inconsistent operation naming conventions.
 
- **Solution** : Use consistent patterns like `{Entity}_{Action}`.
**Chatty API**  
- **Manifestation** : Requires multiple endpoints to complete workflows.
 
- **Solution** : Introduce aggregated endpoints.
**Security Placeholder**  
- **Manifestation** : Insecure placeholder authentication.
 
- **Solution** : Implement OAuth 2.0 or similar schemes.
**Overloading with Webhooks**  
- **Manifestation** : Single webhook for multiple event types.
 
- **Solution** : Use separate webhooks for distinct actions.
**Redundant Parameters**  
- **Manifestation** : Over-reliance on multiple query parameters for basic operations.
 
- **Solution** : Provide sensible defaults.
**Sparse Documentation for Errors**  
- **Manifestation** : Limited detail on error responses.
 
- **Solution** : Use expanded error schemas with actionable fields.
