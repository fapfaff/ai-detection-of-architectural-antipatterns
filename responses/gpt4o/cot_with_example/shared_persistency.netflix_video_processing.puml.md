You are an IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. 
Follow a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. Understand the Context: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture's structure and purpose.
2. Analyze Dependencies: Identify how services interact and depend on each other.
3. Identify Antipatterns: List potential antipatterns and explain why they apply.
4. List each antipattern with the following details
 * The name of the antipattern.
 * A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
 * A proposed solution to address the issue.
 
Example:
**Ambiguous Service**   
- **Manifestation** : Operation IDs such as DoTrunkUpdate, ListRecord are either inconsistent or unclear.

- **Solution** : 
  - Standardize operation naming conventions (e.g., {Entity}_{Action}). 
  - Use consistent action verbs like Create, Update, Delete, Fetch.

The uploaded PlantUML file describes a system architecture for Netflix video processing, containing multiple components, their interactions, and a shared data store. Let's proceed with the step-by-step analysis.

Step 1: **Understand the Context** 
#### High-Level Summary: 
 
- **Purpose:**  This architecture facilitates Netflix's video processing workflow, including encoding, validation, packaging, and quality inspection.
 
- **Components:**  
  - **Core Orchestrators:**  `Streaming Workflow Orchestrator` and `Studio Workflow Orchestrator` coordinate the workflows.
 
  - **Specialized Services:**  Include `Timed Text Service`, `Audio Services`, `Packaging Service`, `Video Encoding Service`, etc., each responsible for specific processing tasks.
 
  - **Shared Database:**  `Video Processing Data Store` serves as a central storage for processed data and metadata.
 
- **Interactions:**  Services interact in a directed workflow managed by the orchestrators, with heavy reliance on the shared data store.


---

Step 2: **Analyze Dependencies** 
#### Service Interactions: 
 
- **Orchestrator-Driven:**  Both orchestrators (`streaming`, `studio`) serve as the primary entry points and coordinate multiple services.
 
- **Inter-Service Dependencies:**  Several services like `ladder`, `complex_analysis`, and `video_validation` depend on `video_encoding` and other components for outputs.
 
- **Shared Data Store:**  Most services (e.g., `video_encoding`, `video_quality`, `video_validation`) rely on the `Video Processing Data Store` for intermediate and final outputs.


---

Step 3: **Identify Antipatterns**  
1. **Shared Data Store Bottleneck**  
  - **Manifestation:**  Excessive reliance on the `Video Processing Data Store` introduces a single point of failure and can cause bottlenecks.
 
  - **Solution:**  Use distributed or service-specific data stores with caching strategies to reduce load on the shared database.
 
2. **Orchestrator Overload**  
  - **Manifestation:**  The orchestrators (`streaming` and `studio`) handle all coordination, leading to potential overcomplexity and scalability challenges.
 
  - **Solution:**  Decentralize orchestration by implementing event-driven communication using a message broker or microservices that coordinate only their direct dependencies.
 
3. **Tight Coupling Between Services**  
  - **Manifestation:**  Services like `ladder` and `complex_analysis` depend directly on multiple other services, creating tightly coupled dependencies.
 
  - **Solution:**  Introduce well-defined APIs or data contracts to reduce direct coupling and increase modularity.
 
4. **Service Naming Inconsistency**  
  - **Manifestation:**  Inconsistent naming such as `Audio Services` (with a typo in "Services") versus others like `Video Encoding Service`.
 
  - **Solution:**  Establish a consistent naming convention for all services.
 
5. **Overloaded Services**  
  - **Manifestation:**  Services like `video_encoding` have too many responsibilities, including generating outputs for validation and storing data.
 
  - **Solution:**  Apply the single-responsibility principle to split these into smaller, focused services.

Step 4: **Antipattern Details** 1. **Shared Data Store Bottleneck**  
- **Manifestation:**  All services rely heavily on a single database, creating a potential performance bottleneck and single point of failure.
 
- **Solution:**  Use distributed storage or service-specific databases. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database read/write overhead.
2. **Orchestrator Overload**  
- **Manifestation:**  The orchestrators (`streaming`, `studio`) handle too many responsibilities, leading to high complexity.
 
- **Solution:**  Decentralize orchestration using an event-driven architecture (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ).
3. **Tight Coupling Between Services**  
- **Manifestation:**  Services like `ladder` and `complex_analysis` have dependencies on multiple other services, creating a risk of cascading failures.
 
- **Solution:**  Define clear APIs and use an intermediary service to decouple the dependencies.
4. **Service Naming Inconsistency**  
- **Manifestation:**  Inconsistent service naming reduces readability and maintainability.
 
- **Solution:**  Adopt consistent naming conventions, such as `{Domain}_{Function}` (e.g., `Audio_Processing`).
5. **Overloaded Services**  
- **Manifestation:**  Services like `video_encoding` perform multiple functions, increasing complexity.
 
- **Solution:**  Decompose into smaller services, such as `Video_Encoder` and `Data_Persister`.
