You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide: 

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

Analyzed
The provided PlantUML file defines a Netflix Video Processing architecture with various components and their dependencies. I will analyze it for architectural antipatterns based on the structure and relationships between components. Below is the analysis:

### Identified Architectural Antipatterns 
1. **God Component** **Manifestation:** 
The "Streaming Workflow Orchestrator" and "Studio Workflow Orchestrator" are directly connected to almost every other component in the architecture. These orchestrators are responsible for interacting with multiple services like `Timed Text Service`, `Audio Services`, `Packaging Service`, and others.
**Proposed Solution:** 
- Decouple the orchestrators by delegating specific responsibilities to domain-specific microservices.

- Introduce event-driven communication or a workflow engine to reduce direct dependencies.


---

2. **Tight Coupling** **Manifestation:** 
Several services like `Ladder Generation Service`, `Video Encoding Service`, and `Complex Analysis Service` have bidirectional or highly interdependent relationships.
**Proposed Solution:** 
- Adopt a more loosely coupled architecture using messaging systems (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

- Clearly define APIs and isolate service responsibilities to minimize inter-service dependencies.


---

3. **Overloaded Data Store** **Manifestation:** 
A single `Video Processing Data Store` is used by multiple components (`Ladder Generation Service`, `Video Encoding Service`, `Video Validation Service`, etc.).
**Proposed Solution:** 
- Implement a database-per-service pattern to isolate data for individual services.

- Use shared-nothing architecture principles to minimize contention on shared resources.


---

4. **Insufficient Service Boundaries** **Manifestation:** 
Some services, such as `Ladder Generation Service` and `Complex Analysis Service`, seem to perform overlapping or unclear responsibilities, leading to ambiguity in service boundaries.
**Proposed Solution:** 
- Redefine service boundaries based on distinct domain capabilities.

- Conduct a domain-driven design (DDD) analysis to clarify the bounded contexts.


---

5. **Single Point of Failure** **Manifestation:** 
The "Video Encoding Service" is directly relied upon by multiple components (`Complex Analysis Service`, `Video Validation Service`), making it a critical point in the workflow.
**Proposed Solution:** 
- Introduce redundancy for critical services, such as multiple instances or fallback mechanisms.

- Use circuit breakers and retries for better fault tolerance.
