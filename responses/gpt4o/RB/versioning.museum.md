You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached OpenAPI file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide:

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

Below is the analysis of potential architectural antipatterns in the provided OpenAPI file:


---

1. **God Endpoint**  
- **Manifestation** : The `/special-events` endpoint handles multiple distinct responsibilities such as creating (`POST`), listing (`GET`), updating (`PATCH`), and deleting (`DELETE`) special events.

- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Segregate responsibilities into distinct endpoints, e.g., `/special-events` for `GET`, `/special-events/new` for `POST`, and `/special-events/{eventId}` for `PATCH` and `DELETE`.


---

2. **Tightly Coupled Responses**  
- **Manifestation** : Shared components like `SpecialEvent` and `SpecialEventFields` are used in different contexts (e.g., creating, updating, and fetching events) without distinction.
 
- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Use dedicated response/request schemas tailored to specific operations. For example, separate `CreateSpecialEventRequest` and `UpdateSpecialEventRequest`.


---

3. **Overfetching Data**  
- **Manifestation** : The `/special-events` endpoint's `GET` operation returns a full list of `SpecialEvent` objects, potentially including unnecessary fields.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Implement query parameters to allow consumers to specify required fields or implement GraphQL for more flexible data fetching.


---

4. **Enum Usage for Extendable Data**  
- **Manifestation** : The `TicketType` schema uses an enum for `general` and `event` ticket types.

- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Use a string type with a `pattern` or `example` for flexibility, or reference a separate resource for ticket types.


---

5. **Lack of Versioning**  
- **Manifestation** : No versioning is evident in the API paths or specification.

- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Introduce versioning in the path (e.g., `/v1/special-events`) or header (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.museum.v1+json`).


---

6. **Inconsistent Error Handling**  
- **Manifestation** : Error responses (e.g., `400`, `404`, `401`) lack detailed or contextual information for consumers.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Standardize error responses to include details such as error code, user-friendly messages, and developer-friendly debug information.


---

7. **Missing Security Best Practices**  
- **Manifestation** : Only a basic HTTP authentication scheme (`MuseumPlaceholderAuth`) is defined.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Replace Basic Auth with OAuth 2.0 or API keys with fine-grained scopes.

  - Ensure the API enforces HTTPS.

These antipatterns highlight key areas where the architecture could be improved for better maintainability, scalability, and usability. Let me know if you need further assistance or more detailed proposals for addressing any of these points.
