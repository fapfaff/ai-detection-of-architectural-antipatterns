You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached OpenApi file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide:

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

Based on the OpenAPI file provided, here are the identified architectural antipatterns and proposed solutions:
1. **Overloaded Schema Definitions**  
- **Manifestation** : Multiple schemas under `voice.v1.permissions` define similar properties with slight variations (`permissions_country`, `permissions_country-instance`, etc.).
 
- **Solution** :
  - Consolidate similar schemas into a single reusable schema with optional fields for specific cases.
 
  - Use `allOf`, `anyOf`, or discriminators for differentiation where necessary.
2. **Insufficient Endpoint Documentation**  
- **Manifestation** : Several endpoints lack descriptions (e.g., `/v1/Trunks`, `/v1/Records/{Sid}`).
 
- **Solution** :
  - Add meaningful and concise descriptions for all operations and parameters.

  - Include examples for request and response bodies.
3. **Unclear Parameter Validation**  
- **Manifestation** : Path parameters like `Sid`, `PolicySid`, and `Country` lack explicit validation rules (e.g., regex patterns or format definitions).

- **Solution** :
  - Define validation rules (e.g., regex patterns, format) for path and query parameters in the OpenAPI schema.
4. **Verbose and Redundant Response Headers**  
- **Manifestation** : Response headers like `Access-Control-*` are repeated across all endpoints.

- **Solution** :
  - Define reusable header components and reference them in responses.

  - Use a global-level configuration for common headers when applicable.
5. **Ambiguous Operation Naming**  
- **Manifestation** : Operation IDs such as `DoTrunkUpdate`, `ListRecord` are either inconsistent or unclear.

- **Solution** : 
  - Standardize operation naming conventions (e.g., `{Entity}_{Action}`).
 
  - Use consistent action verbs like `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Fetch`.
6. **Overuse of Basic Authentication**  
- **Manifestation** : Only a single basic auth scheme (`accountSid_authToken`) is provided.

- **Solution** :
  - Implement and document modern authentication methods like OAuth2.

  - Gradually phase out basic authentication for critical endpoints.
7. **Missing Error Responses**  
- **Manifestation** : Most endpoints only define success responses (e.g., `200`, `201`) without specifying error scenarios.

- **Solution** : 
  - Define standard error response schemas (e.g., `400`, `404`, `500`).

  - Include detailed examples for common error cases.
8. **Deeply Nested Resources**  
- **Manifestation** : Endpoints like `/v1/Policies/{PolicySid}/Targets/{Sid}` exhibit deeply nested resource paths.

- **Solution** :
  - Flatten resource structures where possible.

  - Use query parameters to relate resources rather than deep nesting.
