You are an IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. 
Use the following JSON catalogue of antipatterns as a reference:

Follow a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. Understand the Context: Provide a high-level summary of the architecture's structure and purpose.
2. Analyze Dependencies: Identify how services interact and depend on each other.
3. Identify Antipatterns: List potential antipatterns and explain why they apply.
4. List each antipattern with the following details
 * The name of the antipattern.
 * A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
 * A proposed solution to address the issue.

ChatGPT: 

The uploaded PlantUML file defines a high-level component diagram for an e-commerce system. Here's a summary of its structure:

### Context (High-Level Overview): 
 
1. **Actors and Components:**  
  - Actor: `User`.
 
  - Components: `Frontend`, `Ad Service`, `Recommendation Service`, `Product Catalog Service`, `Cart Service`, `Checkout Service`, `Payment Service`, `Email Service`, `Shipping Service`, `Currency Service`.
 
2. **Databases:**  
  - `Redis Cache` for caching.
 
  - `Order Database` for orders.
 
3. **Interconnections:** 
  - The diagram appears to include arrows to show communication and dependencies between these components.

I will now parse the relationships and dependencies between these components in detail to identify architectural antipatterns. ​​
### Detailed Dependency Analysis: 

Here are the identified interactions based on the parsed PlantUML content:
 
1. **Actor Interactions:**  
  - `User` interacts with `frontend`.
 
2. **Frontend Dependencies:**  
  - `Frontend` interacts with multiple backend services: 
    - `Checkout Service`
 
    - `Ad Service`
 
    - `Recommendation Service`
 
    - `Product Catalog Service`
 
    - `Cart Service`
 
    - `Shipping Service`
 
    - `Currency Service`
 
3. **Checkout Service Dependencies:**  
  - `Checkout Service` interacts with: 
    - `Payment Service`
 
    - `Email Service`
 
4. **Other Notable Dependencies:**  
  - `Cart Service` likely interacts with `Redis Cache` for state management.
 
  - Components like `Currency Service` might depend on external APIs (not explicitly shown but inferred).

### Next Steps: 
I will cross-reference the identified interactions with the provided JSON antipattern catalogue to detect issues and propose improvements. ​​E-Commerce System Dependencies| Source | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| User | frontend | 
| frontend | checkout | 
| frontend | ad | 
| frontend | recommendation | 
| frontend | product | 
| frontend | cart | 
| frontend | shipping | 


I have displayed the e-commerce system dependencies for analysis. Based on these dependencies, I will now identify architectural antipatterns and suggest potential solutions. ​​
### Identified Architectural Antipatterns: 
1. **Ambiguous Interface**  
- **Manifestation:**  The `Frontend` component interacts with multiple backend services (`Ad Service`, `Recommendation Service`, `Product Catalog Service`, etc.) without clearly defined boundaries or purposes. This could indicate a lack of cohesive APIs.
 
- **Proposed Solution:**  Introduce an API gateway to aggregate and streamline frontend interactions. Clearly define service-specific APIs.
2. **Bloated Service**  
- **Manifestation:**  The `Frontend` acts as a central point interacting with nearly all backend services. This could lead to tightly coupled logic and a single point of failure.
 
- **Proposed Solution:**  Decouple frontend responsibilities using micro-frontends or backend-for-frontend (BFF) architecture, enabling services to serve specialized functionality.
3. **Bottleneck Service**  
- **Manifestation:**  The `Checkout Service` is highly connected, handling critical operations (`Payment`, `Email`, etc.). Over-reliance on this service could create performance bottlenecks.
 
- **Proposed Solution:**  Break down the `Checkout Service` into smaller, independently scalable services for payments, notifications, and order processing.
4. **Shared Persistency**  
- **Manifestation:**  The `Redis Cache` is used for potentially multiple purposes (state management, caching, etc.) by several components like `Cart Service`. This could lead to conflicts or degraded performance.
 
- **Proposed Solution:**  Use separate caches or namespaces within `Redis` for different services to avoid interference.
5. **Low Cohesive Operations**  
- **Manifestation:**  Some services, like `Currency Service`, may provide low-value operations (e.g., exchange rate lookups) that could be centralized or offloaded to third-party APIs.
 
- **Proposed Solution:**  Replace such services with well-defined, reusable utilities or third-party integrations.
