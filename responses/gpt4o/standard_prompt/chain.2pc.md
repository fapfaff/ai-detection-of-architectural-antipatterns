You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUml file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide: 

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

The provided PlantUML file describes a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) process in a distributed microservice architecture. Here's an analysis of the architecture and identification of potential antipatterns:

### Identified Antipatterns and Recommendations: 
**1. Antipattern: Distributed Monolith**  
- **Manifestation** :
The system relies heavily on a Coordinator for orchestrating all transactions. Each microservice interacts directly with the Coordinator, creating tight coupling.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Implement a choreography-based approach using event-driven architecture instead of centralized orchestration.

  - Use message brokers (e.g., Kafka) for communication and ensure services react to events independently.
**2. Antipattern: Cascading Failures**  
- **Manifestation** :
The two-phase commit relies on synchronous communication between multiple services (e.g., CustomerMicroservice, OrderMicroservice, PaymentService). Failure or latency in one service can propagate through the system.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Use compensating transactions to handle failures gracefully, allowing eventual consistency instead of strict atomicity.

  - Introduce circuit breakers and bulkheads to isolate failures and prevent propagation.
**3. Antipattern: Over-Reliance on 2PC**  
- **Manifestation** :
The architecture enforces 2PC for distributed transactions, which can be resource-intensive and slow due to locking mechanisms.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Replace 2PC with patterns like Saga for distributed transactions, which provide eventual consistency without global locking.

  - Evaluate the criticality of transactional guarantees and selectively use 2PC only where strict consistency is essential.
**4. Antipattern: Lack of Idempotency**  
- **Manifestation** :
The diagram does not indicate mechanisms for ensuring idempotency in operations such as `PrepareUpdateCustomerFund`, `PrepareCreateOrder`, or `PreparePayment`.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Design all operations to be idempotent by including transaction IDs and maintaining operation state tracking.
**5. Antipattern: Synchronous Dependencies**  
- **Manifestation** :
Services communicate synchronously during the transaction (e.g., Coordinator waiting for responses from CustomerMicroservice and OrderMicroservice).

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Adopt asynchronous communication where possible, with services publishing events and responding asynchronously.

  - Use patterns like Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to decouple commands and queries.

If needed, I can provide an updated PlantUML diagram incorporating the recommended solutions. Let me know how you’d like to proceed! ​​
