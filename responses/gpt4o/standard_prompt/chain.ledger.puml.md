You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide: 

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

ChatGPT: 

The PlantUML file depicts an interaction between a Rider, a Trip Service, a Payment Service, and a LedgerStore. I'll analyze the architectural diagram for antipatterns:


---

**Antipattern 1: Chatty Service** **Manifestation:** 
The Payment Service (PS) makes multiple calls to the LedgerStore (LS) in quick succession:
- Lookup Hold

- Check Hold Status

- Retrieve Hold Details

- Verify Hold Amount
**Proposed Solution:**  
- Use a bulk request approach or a composite API pattern. Instead of multiple calls, PS can request all necessary details in one API call, e.g., `LS: GetHoldDetails`.

- Introduce a caching mechanism to avoid repeated lookups for data that does not frequently change.


---

**Antipattern 2: God Service** **Manifestation:** 
The Payment Service (PS) appears to have multiple responsibilities:
- Authorizing payments.

- Holding and charging funds.

- Handling LedgerStore interactions for hold status, amount verification, and charge creation.
**Proposed Solution:**  
- Break down the Payment Service into smaller, more focused services. For instance:
  - Payment Authorization Service for handling authorizations.

  - Hold Management Service for interacting with the LedgerStore.

  - Charge Service for processing payments.


---

**Antipattern 3: Tight Coupling** **Manifestation:** 
The Trip Service (TS) depends directly on the Payment Service (PS) to authorize and capture payments. The Payment Service, in turn, heavily relies on the LedgerStore for various operations.
**Proposed Solution:**  
- Introduce an event-driven architecture or a message broker to decouple interactions. For example: 
  - TS publishes events like `TripStarted` or `TripEnded`.

  - PS listens to these events and processes payments asynchronously.

- Use well-defined interfaces and contracts to minimize direct dependencies.


---

**Antipattern 4: Overloaded Conditional Logic** **Manifestation:** 
The Payment Service has an `alt` block that handles multiple paths:
- If hold is found, it charges and confirms the transaction.

- If hold is not found, it creates a new charge and verifies it.
**Proposed Solution:**  
- Externalize the conditional logic to a dedicated workflow engine or state machine. For example:
  - Use a saga or orchestration pattern to handle hold-related workflows.

  - Each path (charge or create new hold) is managed as a separate, isolated task.

Let me know if you'd like detailed illustrations of these solutions or further refinement of the architecture. ​​
