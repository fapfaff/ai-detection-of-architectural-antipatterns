You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide: 

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

Based on the PlantUML file content, I will analyze the provided architecture and identify potential antipatterns. Below is the analysis:

### Observed Architecture Overview: 

The diagram outlines a microservice-based e-commerce system with components for frontend, checkout, payment, shipping, recommendation, and others. It also includes databases and a cache for different functionalities.

### Identified Architectural Antipatterns: 
1. **Service Chain Anti-Pattern**  
- **Manifestation** :
The `Checkout Service` depends on multiple services (Payment, Email, Shipping, Currency, Cart, Product). This creates a complex service chain where a single service is tightly coupled to many others.
- **Proposed Solution** : 
  - Use an orchestrator or saga pattern to handle complex workflows. The `Checkout Service` can coordinate the process without being tightly coupled to other services.

  - Introduce resilience patterns, such as circuit breakers and retries, to handle failures gracefully.
2. **Single Point of Failure**  
- **Manifestation** :
`Redis Cache` is used as the sole dependency for the `Cart Service`. There is no mention of a fallback mechanism or redundant cache nodes.
 
- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Implement a fallback mechanism that retrieves cart data directly from a database or another persistent store.

  - Use a distributed or clustered cache setup to improve availability and reliability.
3. **Shared Database Anti-Pattern**  
- **Manifestation** :
Multiple services (`Product`, `Shipping`, `Recommendation`) access the same databases (`User Database`, `Product Database`).

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Enforce the database-per-service principle. Each service should own its database to decouple services.

  - Introduce an API or data access layer to facilitate data sharing instead of direct database access.
4. **Tight Coupling Between Services**  
- **Manifestation** :
The `Frontend` service communicates directly with multiple backend services (Ad, Recommendation, Product, Cart, Shipping, Currency).

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Introduce an API Gateway or Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) layer to mediate and consolidate requests from the frontend to the backend services.
5. **Overloaded Services**  
- **Manifestation** :
The `Checkout Service` has responsibilities that overlap with other services, such as interacting with `Product`, `Cart`, and `Currency` services.

- **Proposed Solution** :
  - Reassess and refactor responsibilities, offloading tasks like cart validation or product checks to specialized services.
 
  - Keep `Checkout Service` focused solely on orchestrating the checkout process.
