You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached OpenApi file to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide:

The name of the antipattern.
A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture.
A proposed solution to address the issue.

Here is the analysis of architectural antipatterns found in the provided OpenAPI specification, along with their solutions:


---

Antipattern: **Ambiguous Endpoint Naming**  
- **Manifestation** : The endpoint `/special-event-management-endpoint` has a lengthy and unclear name.
 
- **Solution** : Use clear and concise names that reflect the resource or action, such as `/events`.


---

Antipattern: **Overloaded Endpoints**  
- **Manifestation** : Both GET and POST operations exist on `/special-event-management-endpoint`, serving different purposes (retrieving and creating events).
 
- **Solution** : Separate responsibilities by creating distinct endpoints, such as `/events` for retrieval and `/events/new` for creation.


---

Antipattern: **Missing Specific Error Codes**  
- **Manifestation** : Many operations use generic responses like `400` or `404`, without detailed error codes for common issues like invalid query parameters or authentication failures.
 
- **Solution** : Include more specific error codes (e.g., `422` for validation errors) and enrich error messages with meaningful details.


---

Antipattern: **Inconsistent Pagination Parameters**  
- **Manifestation** : Query parameters like `page` and `limit` are present, but their implementation varies, and some endpoints omit them.
 
- **Solution** : Standardize pagination parameters and ensure they are consistently applied to all relevant endpoints.


---

Antipattern: **Path Parameter Misuse**  
- **Manifestation** : The `ticket` parameter in `/buy/{ticket}/qr` is not clearly described, and its format (e.g., UUID, string) is left ambiguous.
 
- **Solution** : Clearly document the parameter type and format (e.g., a regex pattern for validation).


---

Antipattern: **Overuse of Basic Authentication**  
- **Manifestation** : The security scheme relies on Basic Authentication (`MuseumPlaceholderAuth`), which is less secure than modern alternatives.
 
- **Solution** : Replace Basic Authentication with OAuth2 or JWT-based mechanisms to improve security and scalability.


---

Antipattern: **Undefined Rate Limits or Throttling**  
- **Manifestation** : The API does not define or document rate limits for endpoints.
 
- **Solution** : Implement and document rate limits for endpoints (e.g., `100 requests per minute per user`).


---

Antipattern: **Minimal Use of Response Schemas**  
- **Manifestation** : Response schemas are minimal and lack detailed descriptions (e.g., `200` responses in many endpoints only specify `type: object`).
 
- **Solution** : Define detailed and structured response schemas with clear property definitions and examples.
