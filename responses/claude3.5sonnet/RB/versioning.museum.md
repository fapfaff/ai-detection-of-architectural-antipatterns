## Prompt:
You are an experienced IT Architect specializing in microservice architectures. Your task is to analyze the attached PlantUML and OpenAPI files to identify architectural antipatterns. For each antipattern found, provide: The name of the antipattern. A concise explanation of how it manifests in the architecture. A proposed solution to address the issue.

## Response:
I'll analyze the OpenAPI specification for the Museum API to identify architectural antipatterns. Let me examine the API design pattern by pattern.

1.  **Chatty API Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: The API requires multiple separate calls to gather related information. For example, to purchase tickets for a special event, a client needs to:
    1.  Call `/special-events` to get event details
    2.  Call `/tickets` to purchase tickets
    3.  Call `/tickets/{ticketId}/qr` to get the entry QR code
*   Solution: Implement a composite endpoint that can return all necessary information in a single call, such as `/tickets/purchase` that returns both the ticket confirmation and QR code in one response. Consider implementing GraphQL for more flexible data fetching.

2.  **Lack of API Versioning Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: The API specification doesn't include versioning in the paths or headers. This makes it difficult to evolve the API while maintaining backward compatibility.
*   Solution: Implement explicit versioning either through:
    *   URL path versioning: `/v1/museum-hours`
    *   Custom header: `X-API-Version: 1`
    *   Accept header: `application/vnd.museum.v1+json`

3.  **Anemic CRUD Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: The endpoints are designed around CRUD operations rather than business capabilities, especially in the `/special-events` endpoints which follow a basic CRUD pattern.
*   Solution: Restructure endpoints around business capabilities and domain-driven design. For example:
    *   `/events/schedule` for scheduling new events
    *   `/events/cancel` for cancellation workflow
    *   `/events/reschedule` for date changes

4.  **Missing Pagination Metadata Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: While the API implements pagination parameters (page, limit), the response schemas don't include pagination metadata (total pages, total items, next/previous links).
*   Solution: Enhance collection responses with HATEOAS-style pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "totalItems": 100,
    "totalPages": 10,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "links": {
      "next": "/special-events?page=2",
      "previous": null
    }
  }
}
```

5.  **Inconsistent Error Handling Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: While there is an Error schema defined, it's quite basic and doesn't provide detailed error information that would help clients handle errors programmatically.
*   Solution: Implement a more comprehensive error response structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_DATE_RANGE",
    "message": "End date must be after start date",
    "details": {...},
    "traceId": "abc-123",
    "timestamp": "2024-12-19T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

6.  **Temporal Coupling Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: The ticket purchasing workflow has implicit temporal dependencies where the QR code generation depends on a successful ticket purchase, but there's no explicit handling of this dependency.
*   Solution: Implement a state machine pattern for ticket processing:
    *   Add status field to tickets (PENDING, CONFIRMED, READY\_FOR\_ENTRY)
    *   Implement webhook notifications for status changes
    *   Add explicit error handling for invalid state transitions

7.  **Missing Rate Limiting Antipattern**

*   Manifestation: The API specification doesn't include rate limiting headers or documentation, which could lead to abuse or performance issues.
*   Solution: Implement and document rate limiting:
    *   Add rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining)
    *   Document rate limits in API specification
    *   Include rate limit status in error responses

These antipatterns could impact the API's maintainability, scalability, and user experience. Addressing them would make the API more robust and easier to consume while better supporting the museum's business operations.
